Registration Of Courses
The student maximum allowed number of credit hours varies between 18 and 20 hours, while the minimum is subject to program duration criteria. In some special cases, a student may register for up to a maximum of 21 credit hours under the following conditions:
•	If the student Cumulative Grade Point Average CGPA is 2 or above
•	If this load will enable the student to graduate at the end of the semester as specified
In the Summer Term, the maximum number of credit hours for which the students can register is 8 hours
To register a course:
•	A student must have completed a prerequisite course. A Prerequisite is a course that a student must take before he/she is allowed to take another particular course.
•	For instance, I student cannot register in Level 2 English before completing Level 1 English. In some cases, a student will also need to register a co-requisite course(s).
•	A co-requisite is a course that is required to be registered simultaneously with another course. Students should consult with their advisors at their schools to learn what courses to register, to avoid delaying graduation.

Welcome to the School of Education
A Message from the Dean of the School of Education

The School of Education's mission focuses on the improvement of learning and teaching in educational settings. We value the importance of teaching and research within a major research university. Striking such a balance depends on three key ideas: focusing our research squarely on the improvement of educational practice, offering high quality programs of instruction for present and future educational practitioners, and collaborating directly with other educators to improve practice. The idea of this balance is incorporated in our mission.

To pursue this mission, four goals guide our decisions and actions. These goals call for the School to focus its work on issues of learning and teaching, offer exemplary programs of instruction, apply knowledge to improve educational practice, and increase diversity in staffing and curricula. In discussing each goal, we will first elaborate on the challenges from which it arises and then outline our recent improvements and new developments designed to achieve it.

  FINANCIAL AID:
Driven by the philosophy of democratizing higher education along with the motto “Education for All” the students should not be denied the opportunity to pursue their university education because of limited financial resources. The Student Financial Aid Package is well-known to meet the goal of the aforementioned philosophy. This is achieved by providing qualified students with financial aid without any discrimination. LIU has created several types of financial aid programs to provide to the needs of new and current students. Following the aforementioned theme LIU grants all newly enrolled students a competitive package of financial aid. However, satisfactory academic progress (SAP) is a requirement for all students receiving Financial Aid at LIU. This generally consists of maintaining, right after attempting thirty Credits, at least a cumulative grade point average GPA of 70 % and passing enough classes (67 % of attempted Credits) with progress toward a degree. However, due to its high operational cost, students in the SoPH are not eligible to Financial Aid
 
  Conditons:
To maintain Financial Aid, a student should fulfill the conditions below:
1.	Demonstrate financial need
2.	Be enrolled with a minimum number of credits each semester as required by the maximum duration of program cycle
3.	Maintain a Cumulative Grade Average of 70 %.
A student is considered ineligible if the followings are taking place:
1.	Receives a scholarship from another institution, equal or exceeding 50% of tuition.
2.	Benefits from a Scholarship
3.	Registers for less than the minimum number of credits each semester as required by the maximum duration of program cycle.
4.	 
  Procedures:
1.	Students may apply for financial aid by filling out an application form, which can be obtained from the Students’ Affairs Office (SAO)
2.	Upon taking this application, the student should schedule an interview with a Financial Aid Officer (FAO), at the Students’ Affairs Office, and submit the complete form along with the appropriate documents before the official deadline. Every semester, dates and deadlines for obtaining and submitting applications will be updated and posted on the LIU website and scheduled in the academic year calendar. The application deadline is at the End of 5th week of an academic semester
3.	Financial Aid applications must be renewed for every academic year before the official deadline of submission of application by filling a ’Renewal Form,’ which can be obtained from the SAO.
4.	Financial Aid Committee will review each application carefully and give the appropriate decisio
5.	Tuition Fees

6.	The tuition fees of LIU are calculated according to the number of credits. All additional education expenses such as, social security fees, registration fees, and books, will not be included within the credit price. LIU has the right to change its tuition fees and charges without notice. Students should pay his or her fees on time or will suffer a penalty. The payment voucher can be found on the UMS account in the payments.

Students can pay at the following banks: IBL, FNB, Credit Libanais, Fransabank, and OMT.

We provide financial aid to all our students. To apply for financial aid, please pass by your business office to fill out an application. Be ready to answer some private questions like, parents’ occupation and income, and who finances your education. The application will be processed and reviewed by a board, which will evaluate whether the applicant is eligible for financial aid or not. In the case of an acceptance, the reviewing board will set the percentage.

The School of Pharmacy has a much studied tuition plan, therefore students accepted to the School of Pharmacy are not eligible for financial aid.
